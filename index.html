    <p>
      Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA 6) is one of the most anticipated video games in history.
      Developed by Rockstar Games, GTA 6 is expected to redefine open-world gaming with
      better realism, storytelling, and freedom than ever before.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is GTA 6?</h2>
    <p>
      GTA 6 is the next main installment in the Grand Theft Auto series after GTA 5.
      The game focuses on crime, open-world exploration, and a cinematic story set in
      a modern-day world inspired by real locations.
    </p>

    <h2>Release Date & Platforms</h2>
    <p>
      Rockstar Games has confirmed that GTA 6 is scheduled to release in 2026.
      At launch, the game will be available on next-generation consoles.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>PlayStation 5</li>
      <li>Xbox Series X / Series S</li>
      <li>PC version expected later</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setting: Vice City & Leonida</h2>
    <p>
      GTA 6 is set in the fictional state of Leonida, inspired by Florida.
      The game marks the return of Vice City, a neon-lit city based on Miami.
    </p>

    <p>
      The map is expected to be much larger than GTA 5, featuring cities, beaches,
      highways, swamps, islands, and rural areas.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Characters</h2>
    <p>
      For the first time in modern GTA history, the game features a female protagonist.
      GTA 6 follows two main characters:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lucia</strong> – A strong, intelligent criminal with a complex past</li>
      <li><strong>Jason</strong> – Her partner, involved in dangerous criminal activities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Their story is inspired by crime-duo narratives and focuses on trust, survival,
      and ambition.
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay Improvements</h2>
    <p>
      GTA 6 introduces major gameplay upgrades compared to previous titles.
      Rockstar is focusing on realism and immersion.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Smarter police and NPC AI</li>
      <li>More realistic driving and physics</li>
      <li>Improved combat and animations</li>
      <li>Dynamic weather and environments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>World Interaction & Realism</h2>
    <p>
      The world of GTA 6 will feel alive. NPCs will have daily routines, react realistically,
      and remember player actions. Many buildings will be enterable, making exploration deeper.
    </p>

    <h2>Graphics & Technology</h2>
    <p>
      Powered by Rockstar’s latest game engine, GTA 6 will feature advanced lighting,
      realistic water physics, detailed character models, and smooth animations.
    </p>

    <h2>Online Mode Expectations</h2>
    <p>
      GTA 6 Online is expected to evolve beyond GTA Online, offering larger lobbies,
      improved role-play features, and long-term updates.
    </p>

    <h2>Why GTA 6 Matters</h2>
    <p>
      GTA 6 is not just a game — it is a cultural event.
      Rockstar’s attention to detail, storytelling, and freedom has set expectations
      extremely high.
    </p>

    <p>
      With its massive world, strong characters, and next-generation technology,
      GTA 6 aims to set a new benchmark for open-world games.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

      GTA 6 represents the future of gaming. While fans still await more official details,
      everything shown so far suggests a deep, immersive, and unforgettable experience.
